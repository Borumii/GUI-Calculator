# Calculator

Calculator application created as a personal project using Java. This was my first project and a way of putting what I had learned in my free time to use making something that I wouldn't have been able to not too long ago.

Looking back I would like to have implemented a cleaner way to deal with the inexactness of numbers in Java rather than trying to simply round off a result to what it was supposed to be. Given more time, I would also have liked to implement other funcionalities as well, such as the trigonometric identities, factorial, outputting mean and variance of a set of data points, and perhaps even graphing capabilities in a seperate window.

BasicCalculator.java is the raw text; lessons folder is the program.
